# Independent Links Plugin 

- **Introduction: ** This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The Plugin extends Obsidian's functionality to enable users to create multiple sets of links on the same documents and gives them control over these sets and their links. The focus is on keeping link information separate from the documents they are connected to without overwriting the original files; links will only be inserted into the document view as they are displayed. Another main feature of the plugin is to allow users to collaborate by sharing sets of links with each other.
  

## Features

- **Link sets (web)**: Users can create different link sets on the same documents. These link sets exist simultaneously and users can activate and deactivate these sets at any time. 

- **Linking ability**: Users can create different type of links: Bidirectional Link, Unidirectional Link, External Links, Link to specific section of the document or specific page within pdf document.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is presented as a settings tab within the application’s settings and includes a range of functionalities that users can perform in order to control their links and link sets.
